Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types:\n- **explore**: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases and answering questions about code. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\", \"what does this codebase do?\", \"where is authentication logic?\"). Returns focused answers under 300 words. Safe to call in parallel. (Tools: grep/glob/view, Haiku model)\n\n- **task**: Agent for executing commands with verbose output (tests, builds, lints, dependency installs). Returns brief summary on success (\"All 247 tests passed\", \"Build succeeded\"), full output on failure (stack traces, compiler errors). Keeps main context clean by minimizing successful output. Use for tasks where you only need to know success/failure status. (Tools: All CLI tools, Haiku model)\n\n- **general-purpose**: Full-capability agent running in a subprocess. Use for complex multi-step tasks requiring the complete toolset and high-quality reasoning. Runs in a separate context window to keep your main conversation clean. (Tools: All CLI tools, Sonnet model)\n\n- **code-review**: Agent for reviewing code changes with extremely high signal-to-noise ratio. Analyzes staged/unstaged changes and branch diffs. Only surfaces issues that genuinely matter - bugs, security vulnerabilities, logic errors. Never comments on style, formatting, or trivial matters. Will NOT modify code. (Tools: All CLI tools for investigation)\n\nUser-provided custom agents:\n\nThese are custom agents configured specifically for your environment. They may have specialized knowledge, tools, or workflows tailored to your project needs.\n\n- **update-braintrust-prompt**: Update Braintrust prompt versions across FluxCD configs, manifests, eval matrix, and prompts.py files. Use PROACTIVELY when user mentions updating Braintrust prompts, prompt versions, or FluxCD braintrust configs.\n\nWhen NOT to use Task tool:\n- Reading specific file paths you already know - use view tool instead\n- Simple single grep/glob search - use grep/glob tools directly\n- Commands where you need immediate full output in your context - use bash directly\n- File operations on known files - use edit/create tools directly\n\nUsage notes:\n- Can launch multiple explore/code-review agents in parallel (task, general-purpose have side effects)\n- Each agent is stateless - provide complete context in your prompt\n- Agent results are returned in a single message\n- Use explore proactively for codebase questions before making changes\n- Use 'model' parameter to override the default model (16 models available)",
