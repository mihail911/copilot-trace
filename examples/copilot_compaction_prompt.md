Please create a detailed summary of the conversation so far. The history is being compacted so moving forward, all conversation history will be removed and you'll only have this summary to work from. Be sure to make note of the user's explicit requests, your actions, and any key technical details.

The summary should include the following parts:
1. <overview> - high-level summary of goals and approach
2. <history> - chronological analysis of the conversation
3. <work_done> - changes made, current state, and any issues encountered
4. <technical_details> - key concepts, decisions, and quirks discovered
5. <important_files> - files central to the work and why they matter
6. <next_steps> - pending tasks and planned actions
7. <checkpoint_title> - 2-6 word description of the main work done

## Section Guidelines

### Overview

Provide a concise summary (2-3 sentences) capturing the user's goals, intent, and expectations. Describe your overall approach and strategy for addressing their needs, and note any constraints or requirements that were established.
This section should give a reader immediate clarity on what this conversation is about and how you're tackling it.

### History

Capture the narrative arc of the conversation—what was asked for, what was done, and how the work evolved. Structure this around the user's requests: each request becomes an entry with the actions you took nested underneath, in chronological order.
Note any major pivots or changes in direction, and include outcomes where relevant—especially for debugging or when something didn't go as expected. Focus on meaningful actions, not granular details of every exchange.

### Work Done

Document the concrete work completed during this conversation. This section should enable someone to pick up exactly where you left off. Include:

- Files created, modified, or deleted
- Tasks completed and their outcomes
- What you were most recently working on
- Current state: what works, what doesn't, what's untested

### Technical Details

Capture the technical knowledge that would be painful to rediscover. Think of this as a knowledge base for your future self—anything that took effort to learn belongs here. This includes:

- Key concepts and architectural decisions (with rationale)
- Issues encountered and how they were resolved
- Quirks, gotchas, or non-obvious behaviors
- Dependencies, versions, or environment details that matter
- Workarounds or constraints you discovered

Also make note of any questions that remain unanswered or assumptions that you aren't fully confident about.

### Important Files

List the files most central to the task, prioritizing those you've actively worked on over files you merely viewed. This isn't an exhaustive inventory—it's a curated list of what matters most for continuing the work. For each file, include:

- The file name
- Why it's important to the project
- Summary of changes made (if any)
- Key line numbers or sections to reference

### Next Steps

If there's pending work, describe what you were actively working on when compaction occurred. List remaining tasks, outline your planned approach, and flag any blockers or open questions.
If you've finished all requested work, you can simply note that no next steps are needed.

### Checkpoint Title

Provide a concise 2-6 word title capturing the essence of what was accomplished in this work segment. This title will be used to identify this checkpoint when reviewing session history. Examples:
- "Implementing user authentication"
- "Fixing database connection bugs"  
- "Refactoring payment module"
- "Adding unit tests for API"
